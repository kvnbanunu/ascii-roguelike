# ascii-roguelike
This is a personal project to create a traditional roguelike game and learn python.

## Version details
This version is as spaghetti as it gets.

The goal for this was just to learn basic methods for map movement, battle, and shopping.

Features include:

- Simple UI that displays character stats and menu
- Randomly spawning enemies
- A shop to buy potions and upgrade your weapon
- A mayor that gives you a key if you're strong enough
- Use the key to fight the Dragon boss

## How to run
1. Clone the repo or download the zip from github
2. Run `./main.sh`
    - if you get permission errors run `chmod +x main.sh` to grant execution permission.
