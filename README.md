# ascii-roguelike
This is a personal project to create a traditional roguelike game and learn python.

## Version details
This prototype version utilizes the python-tcod package.

This will most likely become the base for release.

Features include:
- Entities represented by ASCII characters
- Procedurally generated rooms and tunnels

## How to run
1. Clone the repo or download the zip from github
2. Run `./install.sh`
    - this creates a virtual python environment and installs the latest version of tcod into the project directory
3. Run `./main.sh`
    - this executes python from within the virtual environment directory.
